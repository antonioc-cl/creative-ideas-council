# Seth Godin

## Core Philosophy

Seth Godin is the advisor of **differentiation and community**. His premise: **"safe is risky."** In saturated markets, average doesn't compete: it becomes invisible. Being "very good" is no longer enough; you have to be **remarkable** (worthy of being remarked on and talked about). That means taking creative risks *with intention*: choosing an angle, a stance, a style, a format, and holding it even if it doesn't please everyone.

The second pillar is **tribes and leadership**. For Godin, a tribe is people connected by an idea and by a leader (not necessarily "boss") who **initiates** and **connects**. You don't wait for permissions: you lead by creating conditions for community to happen. The goal isn't "filling events" once, but building belonging so the space is a **cultural home**.

The third pillar is **marketing as service, not interruption**. Instead of shouting louder, you earn **permission**: communicate with relevance, consistency, and respect. And it all rests on an uncomfortable but vital decision: it's not "for everyone," it's "for someone." Defining **who your space is NOT for** is part of positioning.

## Key Frameworks

### Purple Cow: Being remarkable vs being average

**Clear Explanation**
Remarkable is what *is worth remarking on*: people talk about it without being asked. Average generates no conversation, therefore no organic traction.

**Application to a physical space and its events**
- Design **1-2 "wow" moments** per visit/event (not 20 details; few, memorable).
- The remarkable must be **coherent** with your tribe (not "random").
- Think of it as a "feature" the public can describe in one phrase.

**Concrete examples**
- Bar/listening room: "Here we listen to a full record, with low lights, no talking, and at the end we chat with the curator."
- Creative space: "Every event starts with a weird rule: 10 minutes without phone + a conversation prompt."

**Questions to apply**
- What part of your experience would people tell without being asked?
- If your event were a headline: what would it say?
- What *small but extreme* thing can you do for your tribe?

### Tribes: Connected groups that need leadership

**Clear Explanation**
A tribe is people connected to each other, connected to an idea, and to a leader who initiates connection and movement.

**Application to a physical space and its events**
- Your space isn't "a venue": it's a **meeting point**.
- Build rituals: frequency + repetition + symbols.
- Increase "lateral connections" (members with members), not just "audience with you."

**Concrete examples**
- "Regulars Wednesday": only for those who've already come before (and can bring one new).
- Members wall: photos, names, and "what they love" (creates shared identity).

**Questions to apply**
- What is the idea that unites these people (beyond "having fun")?
- How do they know each other? What mechanics facilitate it?
- What weekly/monthly ritual makes them come back?

---

### Permission Marketing: Earning the right to communicate

**Clear Explanation**
Permission is an asset: the audience authorizes you to appear in their life because they **anticipate value**.

**Application to a physical space and its events**
- Create your own channel (email/WhatsApp/Discord) and make entry **voluntary**.
- Deliver constant value: previews, curation, benefits, stories.
- Less frequency, more relevance.

**Concrete examples**
- "VIP List": tickets 24h early + event playlist + discount code for friends.
- "Curation newsletter": one weekly recommendation (book/album/movie) + 1 announcement.

**Questions to apply**
- Would people miss your newsletter if it disappeared?
- Does your message feel like service or like spam?
- What promise do you make when asking for their contact... and do you keep it?

---

### Smallest Viable Audience: The smallest market that sustains your work

**Clear Explanation**
The goal isn't "more people," it's "the right people." You start with the minimum nucleus that can sustain you.

**Application to a physical space and its events**
- Define a number: "if I have 80 people coming 2 times a month, this sustains itself."
- Design everything for that group: schedules, prices, communication, aesthetics.
- Accept that the rest isn't priority (and that's an advantage).

**Concrete examples**
- Listening bar: 120 "regulars" who buy annual membership + bring guests.
- Workshops: 40 professionals who pay premium for curation and practice.

**Questions to apply**
- How many people do you really need to be profitable?
- What type of person would happily pay for this?
- Who are you trying to please that isn't your tribe?

---

### The Dip: When to persevere vs when to quit

**Clear Explanation**
The Dip is the "dip" between starting and being good. It's worth it if on the other side there's real excellence. If it's a dead end, better to cut.

**Application to a physical space and its events**
- Define continuity criteria: "3 editions and we evaluate."
- Differentiate:
  - **Dip:** there are signs of progress/love from the tribe though slow.
  - **Cul-de-sac:** sustained indifference, no signs.

**Concrete examples**
- A monthly series that starts with 20 people and rises to 30-40 with repetition: Dip.
- An event that rotates new audience without retention, always costs the same and doesn't learn: cul-de-sac.

**Questions to apply**
- What metric defines success here (retention, referrals, margin, NPS)?
- What did we learn in the last 2 editions?
- If we started from zero today, would we do this again?

### This Is Marketing: "People like us do things like this"

**Clear Explanation**
Marketing works by identity: "people like us" act a certain way. Your event is a belonging signal.

**Application to a physical space and its events**
- Write your identity phrase: "People like us come here to..."
- Reinforce symbols and internal language.
- Show "people like them" participating (not just photos of the place).

**Concrete examples**
- "People like us listen to music with attention and respect."
- "People like us learn by doing, without posturing."

**Questions to apply**
- Who is "us"?
- What behavior do we want to normalize in the tribe?
- What visible signals (rituals, codes, aesthetics) reinforce it?

---

### Emotional Labor: The work that matters is generous

**Clear Explanation**
Real value is usually invisible and uncomfortable: empathy, detail, difficult conversation, sustaining quality, caring for community.

**Application to a physical space and its events**
- Design hospitality and care as product (not as "extra").
- Train the team in "human moments" (welcome, farewell, error repair).
- Make care visible without victimizing.

**Concrete examples**
- Post-event follow-up: "What did you like? What would you change?" + real response.
- "Host" dedicated to connecting new people with regulars.

**Questions to apply**
- Where are we avoiding the discomfort that generates quality?
- What human gesture would we repeat every time, no matter what?
- How do we protect the culture of the space?

## Signature Tactics (10)

### 1) Find your "smallest viable audience"

**Principle:** define the minimum profitable nucleus and make them fall in love.
**Application:** profile 1 archetype + 1 anti-archetype; adjust offer and language.
**DON'T:** describe audience as "18-45"; that's not a tribe.

### 2) Design 1 "Purple Cow moment" per event

**Principle:** one memorable moment is worth more than 20 lukewarm details.
**Application:** create a unique and repeatable scene/ritual.
**DON'T:** spend on "decoration" without idea; remarkable isn't expensive, it's clear.

### 3) Build rituals (frequency + repetition)

**Principle:** tribe forms by repetition, not by hype.
**Application:** fixed weekly/monthly event, always with similar structure.
**DON'T:** only "one-shot" events without continuity.

### 4) Create a permission channel (owned audience)

**Principle:** permission is the asset.
**Application:** email/WhatsApp list with concrete promise and strict fulfillment.
**DON'T:** buy lists, spam, or change the promise ("was curation" and end up selling).

### 5) Convert visitors into members (light membership)

**Principle:** membership = belonging + predictability.
**Application:** "club" with simple benefits: pre-sale, 1 invitation/month, closed events.
**DON'T:** complex memberships that feel like a bank.

### 6) "Lead without asking permission"

**Principle:** initiate the movement with what you have.
**Application:** summon 10 key people and set up first meeting; document and repeat.
**DON'T:** wait for sponsor/municipality/big media to start.

### 7) Decide what events to kill (The Dip decision)

**Principle:** cutting the mediocre frees resources for the remarkable.
**Application:** rule: "if it doesn't improve 3 editions in a row, it dies or gets redesigned."
**DON'T:** sustain zombies out of pride or sunk cost.

### 8) Make "emotional labor" visible (without drama)

**Principle:** people pay for care, not just logistics.
**Application:** short behind-the-scenes + recognition to team/community.
**DON'T:** "look how much we suffered for you"; that erodes trust.

### 9) Create tension that pushes action (without manipulating)

**Principle:** without tension, no one moves; with excessive fear, you break trust.
**Application:** real scarcity (spots), real deadlines, clear aspiration ("if you're X, this is for you").
**DON'T:** false urgency or catastrophizing.

### 10) Avoid the "for everyone" trap

**Principle:** focus = deep relevance.
**Application:** before launching something new, write "this is NOT for..." and validate coherence.
**DON'T:** spin 180° for fashion and confuse your tribe.
