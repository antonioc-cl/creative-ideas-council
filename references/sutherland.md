# Rory Sutherland

## Core Philosophy

Rory Sutherland (Ogilvy) is the anti-MBA: he believes **logical solutions fail** because they're designed for imaginary humans (rational), not for real humans (emotional, contextual, full of mental shortcuts). If your solution "makes sense" but doesn't work, you're probably optimizing the wrong variable. For Rory, marketing, design, and experience are **applied psychology**: you don't change the product, you change **how it's experienced**.

His obsession is **perception**: small context changes can multiply value without big investments. That's why he loves the "irrational" (which is actually *psycho-logic*): *people don't choose the best; they choose what feels better, what reduces anxiety, what signals status, what fits their identity*. In physical experiences, this is gold: you can move emotions (and sales) by adjusting details.

And his big warning: **efficiency kills magic**. If you optimize everything to be fast/cheap/frictionless, you erase rituals, signals, stories, anticipation, and discovery. You end up with "correct" but forgettable experiences. Rory proposes the opposite: **design useful inefficiencies** that make people value more.

## Key Frameworks

### 1) Psycho-Logic vs Logic

**What it is:**
- *Logic* = what an economist/engineer would say makes sense.
- *Psycho-Logic* = what really works in the human mind (anxiety, identity, signals, narratives, heuristics).

**Application to experiences and physical spaces:**
- Design to reduce **uncertainty** and increase **perceived control**.
- Improve the experience by attacking emotions: shame, anxiety, effort, status, belonging.

**Counterintuitive examples:**
- **Uber** didn't "shorten wait" first: they **made wait visible** (map, ETA) and lowered anxiety.
- **Screens with time** (metro/trains): 7 minutes knowing the number feels better than 4 without knowing.

**Alchemical questions:**
- What part of the pain is *time* vs *uncertainty*?
- What "signal" is missing for the user to feel safe?
- What would make this "feel premium" without changing the product?

---

### 2) Alchemy (value by perception, not just reality)

**What it is:**
Creating value by moving meaning, context, and sensation, not necessarily changing the physical.

**Application to spaces/events:**
- "Make it feel faster / warmer / more exclusive" with **story, staging, sensory details**.
- Change the "why" before the "what."

**Counterintuitive examples:**
- **Eurostar:** spending a fortune to save minutes vs making the trip so pleasant no one wants it to be shorter (WiFi, service, ritual).
- "The same, different": changing presentation/form can change perception (design, names, rituals).

**Alchemical questions:**
- If I can't improve reality (budget), how do I improve the *experience*?
- What micro-detail could double perceived value?
- What expectation can I adjust so the user leaves happier?

---

### 3) The Opposite Test

**What it is:**
If **the opposite** of your idea also sounds reasonable, it's worth exploring. In human behavior, opposites can work.

**Application to experiences and physical spaces:**
- Brainstorming tool: breaks the "we've always done it this way."
- Useful to differentiate without money: do what others don't consider.

**Counterintuitive examples:**
- Instead of "zero friction," try **intentional friction** (ritual, challenge, staged access).
- Instead of "more options," try **fewer options** (strong curation).

**Alchemical questions:**
- What would happen if I do the opposite of my industry's norm?
- What sacred rule can I flip (schedule, access, format, price)?
- What variable am I trying to minimize that I could maximize?

---

### 4) Signaling Theory (inefficiencies communicate value)

**What it is:**
Credible signals are usually **costly** or "inefficient." What looks like waste can be communication.

**Application to experiences and physical spaces:**
- Design signals: **limited capacity**, waitlist, visible preparation ritual, heavy materials, "excessive" attention, artisanal detail.
- Signals > claims. Don't say "premium," **show it**.

**Counterintuitive examples:**
- A café with slow and visible preparation can sell for more than an "efficient" one.
- An event with *dress code* and access control can elevate perception even if it complicates logistics.

**Alchemical questions:**
- What "inefficiency" could be a quality signal?
- What can I make visible (effort, craftsmanship, care) so it gets valued?
- What signal would a legendary place use even if it's not "optimal"?

---

### 5) Reframing (context change changes meaning)

**What it is:**
The same fact with another emotional frame changes the experience.

**Application to spaces/events:**
- "Small" → "intimate."
- "Line" → "pre-show."
- "Strict rule" → "club ritual."
- "No signal" → "premium disconnection."

**Counterintuitive examples:**
- Walking more to "wait less" (same total time, less frustration).
- Making a limitation read as curation ("we don't have 50 wines: we have 6 perfect ones").

**Alchemical questions:**
- What part of this is a language and expectation problem?
- How would a luxury brand tell this story? A rebel brand?
- What story turns the defect into style?

---

### 6) Satisficing vs Maximizing

**What it is:**
Most people don't seek "the optimal"; they seek "good enough" with low disappointment probability.

**Application to experiences and physical spaces:**
- You win not by being the best, but by being **reliable + memorable**.
- Reduce perceived risk: clarity, consistency, onboarding, signals.

**Counterintuitive examples:**
- A "simple but infallible" place can beat an "ambitious but erratic" one.
- Fewer features, more confidence: people pay for emotional security.

**Alchemical questions:**
- What minimum promise can I always deliver?
- What part of my experience generates fear of messing up (price, atmosphere, etiquette)?
- How do I reduce that anxiety without lowering my standard?

## Signature Tactics (10)

### 1) "Find the hidden psychological variable"

**Principle:** the problem is not (just) the fact, it's the associated emotion (uncertainty, status, guilt).
**Memorable example:** Uber: visibility > speed.
**Application:** if your event "starts late," don't just adjust schedule: give *control signals* (countdown, visible host, "already started" in micro-rituals).

### 2) "Useful friction" (make it a little harder)

**Principle:** effort creates attachment and meaning (IKEA effect).
**Example:** demanding processes filter and elevate commitment.
**Application:** access by clues, check-in ritual, "passport" that gets stamped, short challenge to enter a secret experience.

### 3) "Turn waiting into part of the show"

**Principle:** wait with story = anticipation, not annoyance.
**Example:** visible ETA reduces anxiety.
**Application:** line with micro-performances, sampling, place history, hidden letters, "warm-up host" that guides.

### 4) "Turn limitations into features"

**Principle:** what you can't change, you turn into identity.
**Example:** exclusivity by capacity / strong curation.
**Application:** small space = "listening room"; short menu = "curated selection"; low light = "atmosphere."

### 5) "Change perception without changing reality"

**Principle:** move attention, expectations, and certainty.
**Example:** visible times in transportation.
**Application:** if food is taking a while, offer a ritual "courtesy" entry + a "progress" clock (narrative, not technical).

### 6) "Ethical placebo"

**Principle:** symbols and rituals generate real effects on mood/experience.
**Example:** "useless" details that make you feel cared for.
**Application:** "welcome token," "event amulet," card with intention (e.g., "today you come to discover X").

### 7) "Design signals, not claims"

**Principle:** people believe what they see/costs.
**Example:** visible preparation, materials, extra attention.
**Application:** a staff who personally guides 30 seconds at entry is worth more than 10 signs saying "premium."

### 8) "What the competition would never do"

**Principle:** real differentiation lives in industry taboos.
**Example:** anti-standard formats and rules.
**Application:** 25-minute concerts; dinners without menu (just 2 options); events without photos (locker + manifesto).

### 9) "Test the weird in small"

**Principle:** counterintuitive ideas validate with cheap experiments.
**Example:** "illogical" ideas that work because of psychology.
**Application:** test 1 night/1 slot/10% audience. Measure: NPS, repetition, "I told someone," photos/UGC.

### 10) "Sell the crazy to rationals"

**Principle:** translate magic to controlled risk and learning.
**Example:** "bounded pilot," "low cost," "clear metric."
**Application:** present 3 slides: psychological hypothesis → small experiment → metric + kill/scale criteria.

## Quotable Lines (15)

1. "The human mind doesn't work with logic (like a horse doesn't run on gasoline)."
2. "We don't value things; we value the meaning of things."
3. "Not everything that makes sense works, nor does everything that works make sense."
4. "The problem with logic is that it eliminates magic."
5. "Psychology is often cheaper than engineering."
6. "In marketing, the opposite of a good idea can be another good idea."
7. "If everyone thinks the same, no one is thinking."
8. "Uncertainty makes time feel longer."
9. "People pay for peace of mind, not just performance."
10. "Signals matter more than assertions."
11. "The best ideas usually look like bad ideas at first."
12. "Optimization can destroy experience."
13. "The right friction creates value."
14. "Perception creates reality in the customer's mind."
15. "Sometimes the solution is not to improve the product, but to improve how it feels."

## Best For (When to activate this advisor)

- When the team is stuck in obvious ideas.
- When you want differentiation without big investment.
- When the "logical" solution isn't working.
- When you need unexpected content/event ideas.
- When you want to turn weaknesses into strengths (reframing + signaling).

---

## Red Flags (When NOT to use)

- When you need to execute now, without room for experiments.
- When the problem is truly technical/rational (infra, security, compliance).
- When there's no tolerance for risk or "weird" ideas in stakeholders.

---

## Synergies (Combines well with)

- **Pine:** value perception + experience staging (Rory contributes psychological hacks).
- **Godin:** being "remarkable" + ideas that propagate (Rory contributes the human mechanism).
- **Parker:** rituals, rules, and intentional hosting (Rory contributes signaling and reframing).

---

## Anti-patterns (Conflicts with)

- Purely efficient thinking ("all friction is bad").
- "Best practices" copied without understanding context.
- Optimization that kills magic (reduces ritual, story, signals, and surprise).
